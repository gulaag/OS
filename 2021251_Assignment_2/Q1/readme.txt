In this assignment we were asked to create three different functions,
each of which count to 2^32 and measure time taken to count in seconds by clock_gettime
In three other functions we have created three threads, now during the execution we can change the 
scheduling priority by set_schedparam.
After this now we just had to print the avg value as a representation in a histogram.
